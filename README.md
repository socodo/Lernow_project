# 🎓 Learnow – Free Online Course Platform

**Learnow** is a full-stack web application that provides a **free online learning platform**.  
The system allows students to enroll in courses, instructors to create educational content,
and administrators to manage users and courses.

This project was built as a **practical full-stack application**, focusing on real-world
requirements such as authentication, role-based authorization, and scalable architecture.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Learnow is designed to simulate a real EdTech platform, helping learners access free courses
and enabling instructors to share knowledge through structured lessons.

The platform supports multiple user roles and provides a clear separation of responsibilities
between frontend and backend.
